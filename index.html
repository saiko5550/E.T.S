        <p class="p2">‚öô How ENLIL Works
ENLIL turbines are compact, vertical-axis units designed to be installed along:

Highways and busy roads

Metrobus and public transportation lines

Railways and airport runways

Rooftops of high-rise buildings and large commercial facilities

The turbines capture wind generated naturally and by moving vehicles, converting it into electricity. Each turbine also includes an integrated solar panel, allowing for hybrid energy generation (win</p>

        <p class="p3">üåê Smart Technology, Smarter Cities
Each ENLIL unit is equipped with a suite of IoT-connected sensors to collect and analyze environmental data in real time. These sensors continuously monitor:

Air temperature

Humidity levels

Wind speed and direction

Carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) concentration

The data is transmitted securely to a centralized platform, where it's used to generate carbon footprint maps, aiding city planners and environmental agencies in:

Assessing urban air quality

Making data-driven environmental policies

Enhancing public health and sustainability </p>
<br>
<p class="p4"> üõ° Safety Through Innovation
ENLIL contributes to urban safety by integrating an earthquake detection module. This system collects micro-seismic data
 that supports early warning systems, which are especially critical in seismically active cities like Istanbul.</p>
